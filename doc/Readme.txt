Wizard Wars is an action game where two wizards try to gather as many magical items as possible before his opponant does. The player can choose from a variaty of wizards, each with two abilities that either hinder the opponant, such as by stunning lightning bolts or slowing gravity, or make it easier for the wizard to gather the items, such as a quickening wind or an area of fast time.

Made with Microsoft Visual C# 2005 on Windows XP Professional.

Known Issues:
Wizards may not be balanced for fair play
Wizards can still walk through the ground sometimes, especcially when using the Earth Wizard. 
Earth Wizard's abilities can cause terrain anomolies that are pretty unfun.
Item Spawning can lead to someone getting several points by just standing in the same spot.

Future Improvements:
More Sound Effects
More Music
More Wizards/Abilities
Win Animations
Powerups/Random stage events
Network Play
More than 2 players
More Control over Stage Design
